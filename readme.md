## Tarot Cartomancy for the 21st Century!
... Well, almost.  It's just a CLI prototype right now!

## What is Tarot?
No, really, it's okay to not know much, if anything, about tarot cards apart from the spooky three (The Hanged Man, Death, and The Devil) from pop culture.

There are tw main approaches to tarot readings.  Either you believe cartomancy (the use of cards for divination) is literally connecting you to the spirit world, or you believe that cartomancy holds up a mirror for you to reflect on what the cards mean *to you* specifically (or to your client).

The latter is more like homeopathic medicine for the soul and mind.  It can be deeply therapeutic.

## Okay so how do I use this?
Right now, it's just a proof of concept, but it is fully functional.  Just understand that it's a command line script, so, MS-DOS-like windows ahoy!

All you need to do is to enter the number of cards you want to draw.  The program will randomly select one of the 22 cards from the Major Arcana each for the number you enter.  I.e. enter 5 for a 5 card spread, 22 if you're feeling bold, etc.

## I don't know how to read/interpret this stuff...
That's okay!  I'm still learning about it myself, and as I said earlier, the cards' meanings can be deeply personal.  Here's a link to a high ranking google result, but bear in mind, different people, different cultures, have different interpretations, so there's no really 'wrong' answer either.  These are just a rough guide to get you started!

## I'm a professional tarot reader.  Are you going to add the rest of the tarot deck?
I'd like to, eventually, but being honest, I'm still just learning how to interpret the major arcana, myself.  I feel it would be disrespectful to try and cram the other 56 (I think?) cards in when I don't fully understand even a quarter of the full deck yet.

## Okay, you said this is a prototype.  Does that mean you're working on something bigger?
Yup!  I wrote the first prototype in Python because I've always heard Python is good for prototyping new ideas and I wanted to test that theory.  Compared to, say, C++?  I can definitely see the advantages.

I haven't even decided yet whether I want to build it from the ground up in JavaScript, or use an existing graphical engine like Unity or Unreal Engine as the base, yet, though so it may be awhile.

My eventual plan though, is to create a full fledged divination app for both desktop and mobile.
